  What is libbittwiddle
  =====================

Libbittwiddle is a collection of bit manipulation routines.

The included routines are as follows:

 * popcnt

    Computes set bits. Uses a compiler intrinsic if available.
    Results in 12 arithmetic operations.

 * clz

    Computes leading zeros. Uses a compiler intrinsic if available.
    Results in 23-25 arithmetic operations.

 * ctz

    Computes trailing zeros. Uses a compiler intrinsic if available.
    Results in 16 arithmetic operations.

 * check_has_byte_eq

    Checks whether a number has a byte with a value equal to a compile-time
    value x. Results in 5 arithmetic operations.

 * check_has_byte_lt

    Checks whether a number has a byte with a value less than a compile-time
    value x. Results in 4-5 arithmetic operations.

 * check_has_byte_gt

    Checks whether a number has a byte with a value greater than a compile-time
    value x. Results in 3-4 arithmetic operations.

 * check_has_byte_between

    Checks whether a number has a byte with a value between compile-time values
    x and y. Results in 7 arithmetic operations.

All routines are branch-less. A C++11-aware compiler is required.
